Problem Statement – Rocky is a software engineer and he is creating his own operating system called “myFirst os”. myFirst os  is a GUI (Graphical user interface) based operating system where everything is stored in files and folders. He is facing issues on  creating unique folder names for the operating system . Help rocky to create the unique folder name for it’s os.If folder name already exists in the system and integer number is added at the name to make it unique. The integer added starts with 1 and is incremented by 1 for each new request of an existing folder name. Given a list of folder names , process all requests and return an array of corresponding folder names.

Example  :

n=5
foldername= [‘home’ , ‘myfirst’ ,’downloads’, ‘myfirst’, ‘myfirst’]
foldername[0]= ‘home’ is unique.
foldername[1]= ‘myfirst’ is unique.
foldername [2]=’downloads’ is unique.
foldername[3]=’myfirst’ already exists in our system. So Add1 at the end of the folder name i.e foldername[3]=”myfirst1″
foldername[4]=’myfirst’ also already exists in our system.So add 2 at the end of the folder name i.e. foldername[4]=”myfirst2″.
folderNameSystem function has the following parameters

   string foldername[n]: an array of folder name string in the order requested
Returns:

String[n]:  an array of strings usernames in the order assigned
Constraints :

    1<=n<=10^4
    1<=length of foldername[i]<20
    foldername[i] contains only lowercase english letter in the range ascii[a-z]
Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n , denoting the size of the array usernames
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where i<=0<=n) contains a string usernames[i] representing a username request in the order received.
Sample case :

4

home 

download

first

first

Sample Output :

home

download

first

first1

SOLUTION.
As you all might have guessed, this is a problem in which we utilize the hashmap concept. I have solved it in java.
First of all, by analyzing the quesstion the output we want is unique file name.
for example if the files are 
home
dir
home
home
dir
files

the output should be:
home
dir
home1
home2
dir2
files
here the naming conflict is solved.
I initialized a hashmap with key corresponding to the name of file and value isthe occurance of file in hashmap, which is initialized to 0 as no files are there in the hashmap at the beginning.
So the approach that I have used is to read the file names as string from the user and check if it already exists in the hashmap.
It if does not exists we add the corresponding file name and its value as 0.
if it does exist, 
there are two cases:
1) The file name is present in the hashmap, like if we got the first input as home and the next input is also home then we have to make it home1. This is the base case.
2)
when we get the input as the above case but the next file name is home1 itself. That is an edge case. If we approach it using the normal method, there will be repitation.
Hence we would first need to store the file name
